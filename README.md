# Kidney Stone Detection

This project aims to detect the presence of kidney stones using classical machine learning algorithms, ensemble methods, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).


## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- scikit-learn (for classical machine learning algorithms)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- TensorFlow (for the ANN implementation)
